# Demographic Data Analyzer

This is my implementation of the **Demographic Data Analyzer** project from freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python certification.

##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze demographic data from the 1994 U.S. Census database and answer several statistical questions using Python and Pandas.

## What this project does
- Counts the number of each race represented in the dataset.
- Calculates the average age of men.
- Finds the percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree.
- Compares the percentage of people with and without advanced education who earn >50K.
- Finds the minimum number of work hours per week and analyzes income among those who work the fewest hours.
- Identifies the country with the highest percentage of people earning >50K.
- Determines the most popular occupation for high earners in India.

##  Technologies used
- Python
- Pandas

##  Files
- `demographic_data_analyzer.py` – contains the main analysis code.
- `adult.data.csv` – dataset file (not included here due to size; should be added for local testing).

##  How to run
Make sure you have Python and Pandas installed, then run:
```bash
python demographic_data_analyzer.py

 Testing
This project uses simple print statements to verify the output and can be extended with unit tests if needed.

Project built as part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification.
